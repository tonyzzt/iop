- support more switch:
	-e : emtpy output mode. It does not show any data in UI, usually combine use with -r or -s switch
	-p : only list the select process by PID.
	-r : recording the process data realtime (ONLY the last second) to file .
	-s : recording the process data for a long run to a file.
- changed the orginal behavor that the PID shows "?" to the actual PID. It may be a issue caused by reading the /proc/net/tcp earlier than expected.
